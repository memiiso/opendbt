# opendbt

This project adds new capabilities to dbt-core by dynamically modifying dbt's source code.
dbt is a popular solution for batch data processing in data analytics. While it operates on
an [open-core model](https://opencoreventures.com/blog/2023-07-open-core-is-misunderstood-business-model/), which can
sometimes limit the inclusion of community features in the open-source version. no worries opendbt is here to solve it.
opendbt offers a fully open-source package to address these concerns. OpenDBT builds upon dbt-core, adding valuable
features without altering its core code.

`opendbt` unlocks many customizations, allowing you to tailor dbt to your specific needs and data workflows.

With `opendbt` you can go beyond the core functionalities of dbt. For example seamlessly integrating your customized
adapter and providing jinja context with further adapter/python methods.

# Features

- Customize Existing Adapters: Leverage object-oriented programming (OOP) inheritance to create custom adapters that
  inherit from existing ones. Additionally, you can provide Jinja with custom Python methods within your adapter.
- Execute Local Python Code: Use dbt Python models to run local Python code. For example, you could import data from web
  APIs directly within your dbt model.
- Granular Model-Level Orchestration with Airflow: Integrate Airflow for fine-grained control over model execution.
- Serve dbt Docs in Airflow UI: Create a custom page on the Airflow server that displays dbt documentation as an Airflow
  UI page.
- Customized dbt Docs: Replace the default dbt documentation page with your own custom index.html file.

For detailed examples, see: [examples](docs/EXAMPLES.md).
